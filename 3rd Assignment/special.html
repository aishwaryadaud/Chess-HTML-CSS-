	<div class="spe">
	<h2 class="h2">Castling</h2>
	<p>Castling is the only time in the chess game when more than one piece moves during a turn. This chess move has been invented in the 1500's to help speeding up the game and improving balance of the offense and defense. During the castling, the king moves two squares towards the rook he intends to castle with, and the rook moves to the square through which the king passed. Castling is only permissible if all of the following conditions hold:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Neither king nor rook involved in castling may have moved from the original position</li>
		<li>There must be no pieces between the king and the rook</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The king may not currently be in check, nor may the king pass through or end up in a square that is under attack by an enemy piece (though the rook is permitted to be under attack and to pass over an attacked square)</p>
	<h2 class="h2">En Passant</h2>
	<p>En Passant may only occur when a pawn is moved two squares on its initial movement. When this happens, the opposing player has the option to take the moved pawn “en passant” as if it had only moved one square. This option, though, only stays open for one move. The En Passant move was developed after pawns were allowed to move more than one square on their initial move. The idea behind this rule was to retain restrictions imposed by slow movement, while at the same time speeding up the game.</p>
	<h2 class="h2">Pawn promotion</h2>
	<p>If a pawn reaches the opponent´s edge of the table, it will be promoted – the pawn may be converted to a queen, rook, bishop or knight, as the player desires. The choice is not limited to previously captured pieces. Thus its´ theoretically possible having up to nine queens or up to ten rooks, bishops, or knights if all pawns are promoted.</p>
